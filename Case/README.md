# Readme - HR monitor 3D Case
This folder contains the necessary files to 3D print a case for the LIS3DH accelerometer.
* The top part of the case ("Tappo") has two holes to let headers and wiring pass through <br/> and two small walls which are used to keep an elastic band in position.
* The bottom part ("Base") goes in contact with the skin and has two plastic pillars to keep the accelerometer board fixed.\
Base and Tappo can be glued together after the board is put inside.
* The .STEP file contains the 3D model, it can be opened in any 3D CAD app, we used FUSION 360.
