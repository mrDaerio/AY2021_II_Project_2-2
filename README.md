# Project 2 - Heart Rate Monitor
This repo contains all the necessary files to create a heart rate monitor using the CY8CKIT-059, a HC-05 Bluetooth module and a LIS3DH accelerometer.

### User Guide

You can 3D print the case of the accelerometer, look in the "Case" folder for further information.

Double click on the file "Workspace01.cywrk", PSoC Creator will automatically open. Compile the project and upload it on the board.

###### How to wear the sensor?

You can use a rubber band to tie the sensor close to the body like so:
